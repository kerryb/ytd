##Â Building

Compile, test etc:

    make

Build an upgrade tarball:

**Notes:**

  * Set the release version in `VERSION`
  * The release build uses Docker: if you get certificate errors, restart Docker to
		get the VM clock back in sync
	* Make sure the YTD_ERLANG_COOKIE environment variable is set to a suitable
	  secret value

		make build-upgrade

Deploy upgrade:

		make deploy-upgrade

See `Makefile` for other targets.
