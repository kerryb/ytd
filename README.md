##Â Building

Compile, test etc:

    make

Build an upgrade tarball:

_Notes: ensure umbrella app version is updated in `rel/config.exs`, and also
individual app versions (assuming they've changed) in their `mix.exs` files.
The release build uses Docker: if you get certificate errors, restart Docker to
get the VM clock back in sync._

		make build-upgrade

Deploy upgrade:

		make deploy-upgrade

See `Makefile` for other targets.
